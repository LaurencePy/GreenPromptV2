GreenPrompt rewrites your AI prompts to be shorter and more efficient. By minimising unnecessary processing, it reduces wasted energy and helps make your daily AI use more sustainable.

We use a highly efficient and low cost AI model to refine your prompt before it reaches a more powerful model such as GPT-4.
This initial step removes unnecessary information whilst preserving your prompt's functional meaning. This means the larger, more energy-intensive model has less data to analyse, leading to a significant overall reduction in processing and energy use.

Simply paste in your prompt, press optimise, and your new efficient prompt will be copied to your clipboard and ready to use!
